## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React router](https://reactrouter.com/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned how to use the useContext hook to be able to initialize and access the countries array from other modules.

### Continued development

Some of my css is still a bit wonky. For example, the desktop country detail page doesn't maintain proper balance between the flag and info when I expand or contract the window. There are also a few bits of css that I don't really understand. ChatGPT made suggestions and I implemented some of them, but there were one or two that I didn't understand.
